# 4064. Longest Subarray Divisible by K with At Most One Negation II

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

A subarray is valid if its sum is divisible by k, or can become divisible by k by negating one element within that subarray.

Negating an element means replacing its value x with -x.

Return the length of the longest valid subarray. If no valid subarray exists, return 0.

A subarray is a contiguous, non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

## Example 1:
- Input: nums = [4,1,2], k = 3
- Output: 3
- Explanation:
  - The sum of the entire array is 7, and 7 % 3 = 1, so it is not divisible by k = 3.
  - Negating nums[2] = 2 changes the sum to 4 + 1 − 2 = 3, which is divisible by k.
  - Therefore, the entire array is a valid subarray, giving a length of 3.

## Example 2:
- Input: nums = [5,3,4], k = 7
- Output: 2
- Explanation:
  - The sum of the entire array is 12, and negating any one of its elements does not make its sum divisible by 7.
  - However, the subarray [3, 4] has a sum of 7, which is divisible by k = 7 without any negation.
  - Therefore, the longest valid subarray has a length of 2.

## Example 3:
- Input: nums = [2,2,5], k = 6
- Output: 2
- Explanation:
  - The sum of the entire array is 9, and negating any one of its elements does not make its sum divisible by 6.
  - The subarray [2, 2] has a sum of 4. Negating either element changes it to [-2, 2] or [2, -2], both of which have a sum of 0.
  - Therefore, the longest valid subarray has a length of 2.

## Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- -10<sup>5</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- 1 <= k <= 3000
