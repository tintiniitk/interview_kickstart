# 4053. Minimum Operations to Make Every Element Palindromic

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-every-element-palindromic/

You are given an integer array nums.

In one operation, you may choose an index i and either increment or decrement nums[i] by 2.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make every element in nums a positive palindrome. Different elements may be changed into different palindromic integers.

## Example 1:
- Input: nums = [10,12,14,16]
- Output: 9
- Explanation:
  - One optimal sequence of operations is:
    - Decrement nums[0] by 2 once to change it from 10 to 8.
    - Decrement nums[1] by 2 twice to change it from 12 to 8.
    - Decrement nums[2] by 2 three times to change it from 14 to 8.
    - Increment nums[3] by 2 three times to change it from 16 to 22.
    - After 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 9 operations, nums = [8, 8, 8, 22], and every element is a positive palindromic integer.
  - It can be shown that fewer than 9 operations cannot achieve this.

## Example 2:
- Input: nums = [9,10,11,10]
- Output: 2
- Explanation:
  - Decrement nums[1] and nums[3] by 2 once each.
  - After 2 operations, nums = [9, 8, 11, 8], and every element is a positive palindromic integer.
  - At least one operation is needed for each of these two elements, so the minimum number of operations is 2.

## Example 3:
- Input: nums = [125]
- Output: 2
- Explanation:
  - Decrement nums[0] by 2 twice to change it from 125 to 121, which is a positive palindromic integer.
  - A single operation would change it to 123 or 127, neither of which is palindromic. Thus, the minimum number of operations is 2.

## Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 109
